Making it the first post of my first blog.\

The minimalist distill theme was taken from The Mockup Blog[@mock2020building]
and modified according to my need, and
the idea of scripting a darkmode for my distill site is provided generously by
Jannik M. Buhr [@buhr2021making].


My first post is to give credits to people who share their ideas that have
helped me in building this distill blog.
As a beginner who am new to distill and have very limited experience of
front end web programming,
I benefited a great deal from these people's works.


Took me two days to get the site successfully deployed.
Looking forward to putting some actual posts.
