Buhr (Buhr 2021).\r\nMy first post is to give credits to people who share their ideas that have helped me in building this distill blog. As a beginner who am new to distill and have very limited experience of front end web programming, I benefited a great deal from these people’s works.\r\nTook me two days to get the site successfully deployed. Looking forward to putting some actual posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuhr, Jannik. 2021. “Jmbuhr.de: Making a Darkmode for Your Distill Site.” https://jmbuhr.de/posts/2021-03-14-making-a-darkmode-for-your-distill-site/.\r\n\r\n\r\nMock, Thomas. 2020. “The Mockup Blog: Building a Blog with Distill.” https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-01-building-a-blog-with-distill/.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
